This was a project page that was part of The Odin Project. The original assignment was to create a Rock Paper Scissors game, I wanted to jazz it up and had been watching 2001: A Space Oddysey earlier and thought it would be funny to create a game using the idea of Hal as a wise cracking AI opponent. I found an image covered by a public use license, and built the game around the image. This was designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (no library). 

I deployed this project as a github page as well, you can access the page here: https://acer1y.github.io/rock_paper_scissors/ 

I used chat GPT to give a list of 50 Hal styled lines for winning, losing, tieing, and just starting the game. These are stored as arrays and called inside the game logic. This was a fun project and something I should come back to and develop further.
